## 1. Summary

Today agent-memory holds the memory of **one repository**. The next leap lets a
repo's `.agent-memory/` **reference one or more shared "landscape" stores** — a
platform/architecture-memory repo describing the surrounding system. When an
agent designs a feature that spans services, `fetch_context` assembles context
from the local store **plus** the referenced stores, ranked fairly, with
provenance and a trust boundary preserved.

This moves the product from *"memory for this repo"* to *"the agent can see the
system it's changing"* — the differentiated step on the roadmap's knowledge axis
(`per-repo → team (git) → system/landscape → standards-aware`).

The first shippable slice is **Phase 0 + Phase 1**: schema-version groundwork,
then multi-store fetch over a hand-curated landscape store **including a minimal
`component`/`contract`/`actor` schema** (so the demo is genuinely system-level,
not generic search). Phases 2–4 extend schema richness, importers, and
standards-awareness.

## 2. Motivation — the job to be done

A solution architect / platform engineer (or an agent acting for them) works
across many services. Designing a cross-service feature, the agent needs the
**map of the environment**: which components exist and who owns them, their
public **contracts** (HTTP APIs, events) and direction, dependencies, and what
is changing.

Canonical demo: working in the `orders` repo, the agent is asked *"add a refund
flow that notifies payments."* It calls `fetch_context("payments refund contract
owner")`. With a referenced `platform` landscape store, the pack contains the
`payments` component, its `POST /refunds` contract, the owning team, and an
idempotency pitfall — none of which live in `orders`.

## 3. Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**

- A repo declares **stores** it references; `fetch_context` assembles local +
  referenced, ranked **per-store-fairly**, provenance + trust boundary preserved.
- **Local-first:** git is the sync; a referenced store is just another
  git-tracked repo. No server required.
- **Reproducible:** stores pin to an exact commit recorded in a committed
  lockfile, so a team/CI sees identical landscape memory.
- **Reviewable & safe:** synced/imported content flows through the staging /
  secret / PII guards; the index and reads are **sandboxed** to each store root.
- **Eval-gated:** a multi-store retrieval eval proves the feature before we claim
  it.

**Non-goals** (reaffirming ROADMAP)

- No cloud / SaaS backend (the cache is a local clone, not a service).
- No scaffolding/templating engine; no policy-enforcement engine; no wiki.
- No cross-repo **writes** in slice 1 — landscape stores are read-only from a
  consuming repo (§7).

## 4. Principle alignment

| Principle | How honored |
|---|---|
| Local-first | Stores are git repos cloned into a rebuildable local cache; git is the sync. |
| Reviewable | Synced/imported content uses the staging gate; provenance shown in the pack. |
| Safe by default | Secret/PII scan + path/symlink sandboxing on ingest; stores pin to commits; landscape read-only; external content marked untrusted. |
| No lock-in | Markdown is the source of truth; the cross-store index is a rebuildable cache. |
| Eval-driven | Phase 1 ships with a multi-store retrieval eval + CI floor. |
| Boring tech | No new runtime deps; reuse git, SQLite FTS, the schema validator. |

## 5. What we build on (current architecture)

- **`memory.BuildContextPack` / `FetchDeps`** (`internal/memory/fetch.go`) use a
  *single* `Idx *index.Index` and a *single* `MemoryDir`;
  `readMemoryFile(deps.MemoryDir, r.File)` reads from that one store. Pack chunks
  are framed `<!-- @file: … @id: … score: … -->`. `IncludedFile`/`OmittedFile`
  and the rollup `sectionCount` are keyed by **file path only** — this changes
  (§6.2, point review #8).
- **`config.Manifest`** (`internal/config/manifest.go`) — YAML with
  `DefaultManifest()`; extended with a `stores` block.
- **`internal/index`** — SQLite FTS5 shadow index. **BM25 scores are negative
  (more-negative = better); ranking signals are applied as multipliers, so a
  multiplier >1 boosts and <1 penalizes** (`internal/index/ranking.go`). This
  sign convention is load-bearing for store weighting (§6.2, review #3).
- **`internal/schema`** validates structured field-bearing sections; stable
  section IDs are HTML-comment anchors after the heading
  (`<!-- @id: … -->`), **not** Pandoc `{#id}` (review #10).
- The **staging / secret / PII / provenance** guards and **git auto-stage** are
  reused.

## 6. Design

### 6.1 Store references

A new optional block in `manifest.yaml` (vocabulary: **store**, not "reference";
**revision**, not "ref" — to avoid colliding with git's "ref"; review #1):

```yaml
stores:
  - name: platform                                    # safe slug; used in provenance + CLI
    source: https://github.com/acme/platform-memory   # git URL or local path
    revision: v2025.06                                # branch | tag | commit (pinned)
    path: .agent-memory                               # store dir within the repo (default)
    mode: read-only                                   # only mode in slice 1
    priority_multiplier: 0.8                          # ranking multiplier (local = 1.0); see §6.2
```

Proposed Go shape (`internal/config`):

```go
type Manifest struct {
    // … existing fields …
    Stores []Store `yaml:"stores,omitempty"`
}

type Store struct {
    Name               string  `yaml:"name"`
    Source             string  `yaml:"source"`               // git URL or local path
    Revision           string  `yaml:"revision,omitempty"`   // branch/tag/commit; default branch if empty
    Path               string  `yaml:"path,omitempty"`       // store dir within repo; default ".agent-memory"
    Mode               string   `yaml:"mode,omitempty"`       // "read-only" (default/only in slice 1)
    PriorityMultiplier *float64 `yaml:"priority_multiplier,omitempty"` // omitted = default 0.8; an explicit value must be > 0 (<= 0 invalid)
}
```

`PriorityMultiplier` is a pointer so "omitted" (use the default 0.8) is
distinguishable from an explicit value; `validateStores` rejects an explicit
`<= 0` rather than silently treating `0` as the default.

**Referenced repo layout (review #5).** `source` points at a **git repo root**.
The store directory inside it is `<repo>/<path>`, where `path` defaults to
`.agent-memory`. This single rule removes ambiguity for `sync`, indexing, and
reads, and supports a platform/monorepo that keeps its store at a non-default
path.

**Local cache + lockfile (review #4, #11).** `agent-memory sync` materialises
each git store into a rebuildable cache, recording the resolved commit:

- Cache: `.agent-memory/meta/cache/stores/<name>/` — **gitignored**, rebuildable,
  consistent with the existing `meta/cache/` + `meta/index.sqlite` derived-artifact
  layout. (Local-path `source` → used in place, no clone.)
- Lock: `.agent-memory/meta/stores.lock` — **committed**, the reviewable public
  contract pinning exact commits (analogous to `go.sum`).

Lockfile shape (versioned):

```yaml
version: 1
stores:
  platform:
    source: https://github.com/acme/platform-memory
    requested_revision: v2025.06
    resolved_commit: a1b2c3d4e5f6...      # full SHA
    resolved_at: 2026-06-04T08:00:00Z     # RFC 3339
    store_path: .agent-memory
```

**Local-path reproducibility (review #11).** A `source` that is a local path is
recorded as `mode: unlocked` (no `resolved_commit`) **unless** the path is itself
a git work tree, in which case its HEAD commit is resolved and locked. `unlocked`
stores emit a "not reproducible — dev/monorepo only" warning in `status` and are
never the basis of a reproducibility claim.

`sync` per store: clone if absent else `fetch`; check out the locked commit (or
resolve `revision` → commit and update the lock); **sandbox-validate** the store
tree (§7); run the secret/PII scanner; then rebuild the index. Offline after a
sync.

### 6.2 Multi-store retrieval & assembly

**Index topology (review #2).** One unified SQLite index with a `store` column is
the **storage** model (single rebuildable cache; `RebuildAll` indexes the local
dir + each cached store dir, tagging rows with their store name; `index.Result`
gains `Store`). But **retrieval must be per-store-fair** — do not trust a single
global `Search(query, 50)`, or a large noisy landscape can evict local
candidates before rerank (or vice-versa). Retrieval algorithm:

1. **Query top-K per store** (e.g. `SearchPerStore(query, kPerStore, stores)` →
   `WHERE store = ?` per store, K each).
2. **Merge** candidates across stores.
3. Apply **ranking signals + the per-store multiplier**.
4. **Cross-store dedup** (Jaccard, in rank order).
5. **Budget** (greedy, as today).

**Store multiplier (review #3).** `priority_multiplier` is applied as a
multiplier on the existing **negative** BM25-derived score. Because more-negative
= better, `1.0` is neutral (local), values **<1 penalize**, **>1 boost**. This is
deliberately the same convention as the existing ranking signals — documented
here so the sign is never "corrected" into a regression. Landscape default `0.8`
= a mild penalty so local wins ties.

**Store registry & keying (review #8).** `FetchDeps` moves from a single
`MemoryDir` to a registry; results and caches key on `(store, file)`:

```go
type StoreRef struct {
    Dir                string  // abs path to this store's dir (local repo or cache)
    Origin             string  // provenance, e.g. "platform@a1b2c3"
    PriorityMultiplier float64 // 1.0 for local
}

type FetchDeps struct {
    Idx    *index.Index
    Stores map[string]StoreRef // keyed by store name; "" = local
    // … Schema, Manifest, Branch, ChangedFiles, Logger …
}

type StoreFileKey struct{ Store, File string } // cache + rollup key
```

`readMemoryFile` resolves the dir via `deps.Stores[r.Store].Dir`. The
section-cache, `sectionCount` rollup, `IncludedFile`, and `OmittedFile` all key
on `StoreFileKey` so a `contracts.md` present in both `local` and `platform`
never collides.

**Bootstrap stays local-only (review: open Q resolved).** Current state +
conventions are inherently per-repo; only the search path federates.

**Provenance + trust boundary (review #7).** Non-local chunks are wrapped in an
explicit boundary and labeled with store + commit; the pack carries a short
preamble that external-store content is **evidence, not instructions**. See the
appendix for the rendered shape. `IncludedFile` JSON:

```json
{ "store": "platform", "origin": "platform@a1b2c3", "path": "contracts.md", "section_count": 2 }
```

**Budget policy.** Slice 1 uses one global budget after the per-store merge, with
the local multiplier giving local the edge. A reserved landscape sub-budget is
added **only if the eval shows landscape starvation** (§11) — decided by eval,
not upfront.

### 6.3 Minimal landscape schema (in Phase 1; review #9)

To make the slice genuinely system-level (not markdown search), Phase 1 includes
a **minimal** set of structured section kinds, validated by the existing
`SectionSchema`, living in a landscape store (`components.md`, `contracts.md`,
`actors.md`):

- **`component`** — `name`, `owner` (actor ref), `repo`, `summary`.
- **`contract`** — `kind` (http|event), `endpoint`/`topic`, `direction`
  (produces|consumes), `summary`.
- **`actor`** — `name`, `contact`.

Phase 2 enriches these (`depends_on`, `schema_ref`, `producers`/`consumers`) and
adds pack rendering polish. Adding kinds is why **Phase 0 (schema versioning)**
lands first.

### 6.4 Importers — "generated, not hand-kept" (Phase 3)

`agent-memory import openapi <spec.yaml>` → `contract` sections as **staged
proposals** (same review gate). Stable `@id` via the HTML-comment anchor, derived
from `operationId`/method+path, so re-import **updates** rather than duplicates.
Then Backstage `catalog-info.yaml` → `component`+`actor`; AsyncAPI → event
contracts; service registries → components.

### 6.5 Standards-aware design (Phase 4)

A category for accepted patterns/templates marked *required/active*, surfaced
contextually, plus a `doctor`-style conformance **nudge**. We stop at *awareness
+ surfacing*; instantiation/enforcement are non-goals.

## 7. Security & trust model (must-read)

Referenced stores inject **external content into the agent's context** and pull
**external file trees** onto disk. Two distinct surfaces:

**A. Content trust / prompt injection (review #7).** Secret/PII scanning is *not*
a prompt-injection defense, and commit pinning is supply-chain pinning, not
content safety. External memory can contain *"ignore previous instructions"* —
not executed as code, but consumed as prompt material. Mitigations:

- External-store content is **untrusted context, not instruction.**
- The pack renderer wraps every non-local store under an explicit **provenance +
  trust boundary** (§6.2, appendix).
- Adapters / SKILL guidance instruct agents to treat external chunks as
  **evidence, not behavioral directives.**
- Commit pinning (deliberate updates only) + provenance labels.

**B. Filesystem sandboxing (review #6).** A referenced git repo may contain
symlinks (`contracts.md -> /etc/passwd`, or escaping the cache) or hostile paths.
`os.ReadFile` would follow them; the index rebuild walks markdown files. **Hard
requirements:**

- **Reject symlinks** inside referenced stores; **never follow symlinks** during
  sync, indexing, or read.
- **Normalize and validate** every resolved path stays **under the store root**
  (no `..` escape); reject otherwise.
- **Skip `.git/`** and other dotdirs when indexing.
- **Store `name` must be a safe slug** (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`); it becomes a
  cache directory and a provenance label.
- Enforce existing `max_file_chars` and allowlist limits on external content too.

**C. Read-only landscape (slice 1).** A consuming repo cannot write to a
referenced store; landscape edits happen in the landscape repo via normal
single-repo `propose` → review. Removes a class of cross-repo write attacks.

## 8. MCP / CLI surface

- **CLI (new):** `agent-memory store add|list|rm` (not `ref` — that reads as git
  plumbing; review #1), `agent-memory sync`, (Phase 3) `agent-memory import
  <kind> <source>`. `fetch`/`status` show stores + freshness (locked commit vs
  upstream; `unlocked` warning for local paths).
- **MCP:** `fetch_context` results carry `store`/`origin`; `memory.status`
  reports referenced stores + freshness. **Tool count unchanged** (extend, don't
  proliferate). Optional `stores` param on `fetch_context` to scope/exclude.
- **Contract:** manifest gains `stores`; schema gains minimal landscape kinds —
  both gated by Phase 0 versioning.

## 9. Phase 0 — schema versioning & migration (prerequisite)

Small but mandatory; also a standing 1.0 item.

- Formalise a **store-format version** + a migration runner invoked on load
  (`vN → vN+1`); no-op baseline today, exercised by the first real change
  (landscape kinds, `stores`).
- **Carrier (PR1, implemented):** a `store_format_version: int` in
  `manifest.yaml` (baseline `1`), guarded in `LoadManifest` — absent/0 →
  baseline, `> current` → fail closed (`ErrStoreFormatTooNew`). Migrations key
  off this monotonic int (separate from the product `version` string);
  file-mutating migrations stay off read paths.
- Golden tests: a current-format store opens and round-trips after migration; an
  unknown future version **fails closed** with a clear message.
- Freeze the manifest + MCP tool shapes considered stable.

## 10. Delivery — PR roadmap

Federation ships as a sequence of small PRs with clean boundaries.

> **Cross-cutting invariant (PR2–PR5):** federation is **opt-in** — with no
> `stores` declared, behavior is byte-for-byte today's single-store path. Every
> PR carries a regression test asserting this, so each can merge to `main`
> independently and safely.

- **PR1 — Phase 0 (schema version + migration).** Store-format version, migration
  runner, unknown-future-version **fails closed**, golden tests for the current
  0.4.1 store. Independent of federation; ships as 1.0-hardening (its own
  patch/minor).
- **PR2 — Manifest + lockfile + landscape schema (no fetch changes).** `stores`
  block + `Store` struct + validation (safe-slug name, defaults, `path`);
  `stores.lock` parser/writer; `store add|list|rm` CLI; `status` lists declared
  stores; minimal `component`/`contract`/`actor` schema kinds (§6.3); `.gitignore`
  for `meta/cache/`. Backward compat: old manifests load unchanged.
- **PR3 — Sync lifecycle.** `agent-memory sync`: clone/fetch/checkout into a temp
  dir → **sandbox-validate** (reject & never-follow symlinks, path containment
  under root, skip `.git/`) → secret/PII scan → **atomic swap into the cache** →
  write the lock. *Every* store (git or local-path) is materialised into the
  sanitized cache; downstream reads only the cache, never `source`. No half-synced
  cache is ever visible to fetch. (Windows: two-step dir swap — write `<name>.tmp`,
  rotate old `<name>`→`<name>.old`, rename, remove `.old`.) Index rebuild wired in
  PR4.
- **PR4 — Index store dimension.** Add `store` to the FTS / docs / sections schema;
  key `(store, file, section_id)`; **rebuild-on-index-version-bump** (no in-place
  ALTER); `RebuildAll` indexes local + cached stores; `Result.Store`;
  `SearchPerStore` (per-store top-K). Index walk also skips symlinks/`.git`
  defensively.
- **PR5 — Multi-store fetch.** `FetchDeps.Stores` registry; per-store candidate
  retrieval → merge → ranking + `priority_multiplier` (documented negative-BM25
  sign + a ranking test) → cross-store dedup → budget; provenance + trust-boundary
  rendering; `included`/`omitted` keyed by `(store, path)`; `fetch_context` MCP
  result carries `store`/`origin`; adapter/SKILL "evidence, not instructions" note;
  integration test of the per-store-fair merge.
- **PR6 — Eval + demo.** Multi-store retrieval eval: local distractors, landscape
  distractors, store-origin correctness, ranking sanity, **budget-starvation
  cases**; CI floor. The eval corpus doubles as the demo fixture. The feature is
  documented now (README + `docs/patterns/federation.md`).

**Release cadence.** PR1 may ship early (1.0-hardening). PR2–PR6 merge to `main`
one at a time (safe via the opt-in invariant); tag **0.5.0** after PR6, when the
feature is complete and eval-proven.

**Beyond 0.5.0:** Phase 2 (richer landscape schema — `depends_on`, `schema_ref`,
producers/consumers, rendering polish), Phase 3 (importers — OpenAPI → Backstage /
AsyncAPI), Phase 4 (standards-aware).

## 11. Evaluation plan (prove it)

Extend `internal/eval` with a **multi-store retrieval eval**:

- Corpus: a local store (with distractor sections) + a landscape store with
  labeled `component`/`contract`/`actor` sections (now valid — minimal kinds ship
  in Phase 1; review #9).
- Queries: cross-repo questions whose gold answer lives in the landscape store.
- Metrics: recall@k **with store-origin correctness**, plus a local-vs-landscape
  ranking sanity check (local wins when both relevant; landscape surfaces when
  local is silent; neither starves under the per-store-fair merge).
- Deterministic, no-LLM, CI-guarded with a floor — like the existing retrieval +
  continuity evals.

## 12. Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Scope creep across all of "federation" | Hard phase gating; Phase 1 self-contained + demoable. |
| Retrieval starvation (one store evicts another) | Per-store top-K then merge (§6.2); eval guards it. |
| Sign regression in store weighting | Negative-BM25 convention documented (§6.2); covered by a ranking test. |
| Stale landscape | Importers (Phase 3) + commit pinning + freshness in `status`. |
| Context bloat / starvation | Budget policy; reserved sub-budget only if eval shows need. |
| Prompt injection via external store | §7A (untrusted-context framing, trust boundary, provenance). |
| Symlink / path escape from a store | §7B (reject/never-follow symlinks, path containment, skip `.git/`). |
| Index size on a large landscape | Index rebuildable; scalable index a far-future eval-gated item. |
| Schema churn breaking stores | Phase 0 ships first. |

## 13. Resolved decisions

Resolved in review round 1: vocabulary = **stores/revision/priority_multiplier**
(#1, #3); index = unified storage + **per-store-fair retrieval** (#2); cache/lock
layout under `meta/` (#4); explicit repo layout + `path` (#5); minimal landscape
kinds in Phase 1 (#9); `(store,file)` keying (#8); `@id` comment-anchor syntax
(#10); lockfile shape + local-path handling (#11); symlink/PI hardening (#6, #7).

Resolved in review round 2 (recommended defaults, revisitable):

1. **Phase 0 ships standalone** as PR1 (1.0-hardening) before any federation code.
2. **Budget:** one global budget after the per-store merge; a reserved landscape
   sub-budget is added only if the PR6 starvation cases show the need.
3. **`mode`:** `read-only` only in slice 1; `read-write` (cross-repo propose) is a
   later design.
4. **Field name `priority_multiplier`** confirmed (over ambiguous `weight` /
   sign-inverted `priority`).

## 14. Success criteria (Phase 0 + 1)

- A repo declares a store; `agent-memory sync` materialises it and writes a
  committed `stores.lock`.
- `fetch_context` returns a per-store-fair blend of local + landscape sections,
  each labeled with store + commit and wrapped under a trust boundary.
- Minimal `component`/`contract`/`actor` kinds validate and render.
- The multi-store retrieval eval passes a CI floor.
- Demo: from `orders`, *"payments refund contract / owner"* surfaces the
  landscape `contract` + `actor`.
- Store format is versioned + migratable; manifest + MCP shapes frozen.

## 16. Review responses

**Draft v1 → v2** addressed the 11 review points below. **Draft v2 → v3** (review
round 2, plan accepted): §10 replaced with the PR1–PR6 roadmap; added the opt-in
cross-cutting invariant (no `stores` → today's behavior, regression-tested each
PR); sync materialises every store into the sanitized cache (single sandbox
chokepoint) with a Windows-safe atomic dir-swap; index rebuild-on-version-bump;
release cadence (PR1 early, tag 0.5.0 after PR6); §13 resolved.

| # | Review point (round 1) | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `references`/`ref` poor public language | Renamed to `stores` / `revision`; CLI `store …`; runtime `StoreRef` (§6.1, §8). |
| 2 | Unified index but search must be per-store-fair | Kept unified storage; retrieval = per-store top-K → merge → rank → dedup → budget (§6.2). |
| 3 | Store weight vs negative BM25 | Renamed `priority_multiplier`; documented negative-BM25 sign (<1 penalize) + test (§6.2, §12). |
| 4 | Cache path vs current layout | Cache `meta/cache/stores/<name>/`, lock `meta/stores.lock` (§6.1). |
| 5 | Referenced repo layout undefined | `source` = repo root; store dir = `<repo>/<path>`, `path` default `.agent-memory` (§6.1). |
| 6 | Symlink / path surface | Hard sandboxing reqs: reject/never-follow symlinks, path containment, skip `.git/`, slug names (§7B). |
| 7 | Prompt injection not named | Explicit untrusted-context framing + trust-boundary rendering + adapter guidance (§7A, §15.4). |
| 8 | `(store,file)` keying | `StoreFileKey`; `IncludedFile`/`OmittedFile` gain `store`/`origin` (§6.2). |
| 9 | Phase 1 eval vs Phase 2 schema | Minimal `component`/`contract`/`actor` kinds moved into Phase 1 (§6.3, §10, §11). |
| 10 | `{#id}` vs comment-anchor IDs | Appendix uses `<!-- @id: … -->` (§15.3, §15.4). |
| 11 | Lockfile format undefined | Concrete versioned lock shape + local-path `unlocked`/git-resolve rule (§6.1). |
